    "\n",
    "In the example above, the frequency of the behavior is approximately 10 Hz, i.e. the core of the loop is executed approximately 10 times per second (because we wait for 0.1s at the end of each iteration). This is an approximation because we don't take into account the time needed to execute the instructions occurring before the waiting period. Step (1) corresponds to the reading of the left and right proximeter activations. Step (2) corresponds to the computation of `wheel_activation` according to the sum of the proximeter activations. Finally, Step (3) corresponds to setting the speed of both wheels to the value of `wheel_activation`.\n",

This is what is done in the function definition just above.\n",
