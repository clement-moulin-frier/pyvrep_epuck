You can use the scene rotation, translation and zooming buttons to inspect the robot in more detail. However it is not recommended to save the modified scene, since the scene view has been chosen to be convenient for the exercises below.

    "The cell above defines a function called `slow_down`. In computer programming, a function is a sequence of instructions that perform a specific task depending on some parameters (called the arguments of the function) and that returns a result. In this sense it is very similar to the mathematical definition of a function, as for example when we write `y = f(x)`, where `f` is the name of the function, `x` is its argument, and `y` is the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "As seen above, the definition of a function in Python starts with the keyword `def`, followed by the arbitrary name we choose for the function (here we called it `slow_down` to reflect the purpose of the behavior defined in it). Then come the arguments of the function in parenthesis (in our case it will be the variable representing the robot, called `epuck`) and finally the symbol `:`. Below the first line, you find the instructions that this function will execute when it will be called. Those instructions need to be intended right with respect to the first line. In this example, the instructions are the exact same as in the core of the previous `for` loop, except that:\n",
    "- we omit the last line `epuck.wait(0.1)` (the frequency at which the behavior will be executed will be set in more rigorous way below),\n",
    "- we don't directly set the motor activations using `epuck.left_wheel` and `epuck.right_wheel`. Instead, we *return* the values of the motor activations in the last line and they will be automatically sent to the robot motors when the behavior will be executed. In the last line, the values after the `return` keyword have to be the left and right speed activation (in this order). Both activations have to be between 0 and 1. (In the `slow_down` behavior above, both activations are the same since we don't want the robot to turn).\n",

    "- It is equipped with two sensors that are activated according to the proximity of a source. With the ePuck, each proximeter sensor returns a value between 0 and 1 that is inversely proportional to the distance from the closest obstacle it perceives (the closer the obstacle, the highest to proximeter activation).\n",
    "- It is equipped with two motors allowing the robot to move. With the ePuck, we can set the activation of each wheel independently with a value between 0 and 1 (where 1 means maximum speed). \n",
    "- A behavior links sensor activations to motor activations. In the Braitenberg vehicles, this is achieved through connections that are either excitatory (the activity of the sensor increases the activity of the motor it is connected to) or inhibitory (the activity of the sensor decreases the activity of the motor it is connected to). In the ePuck, we have seen above that we can define a behavior as a function that (1) read the sensor activities (2) perform some computation and (3) use the result of that computation to set the wheel speed. \n",
